                Pointé is a collection of technological products focused on the classical area of dance, serving as
                monitoring instruments to improve the dancer's personal and academic training. Pointé
                represents the perfect fusion between classic and modern, uniting two completely different centuries and
                disciplines in a complementary way. Pointé is the place where the classical and innovation come together
                as one.

                Objective
            </h1>
            <p>
                In an art as conservative and demanding as ballet, dancers tend to face multiple challenges, both
                physical and mental. One of the most common physical challenges that tend to slow down an artistic
                career in its prime is injury. The purpose of this innovative range of interconnected technologies is to
                reduce them by monitoring movements, simulating some of the health and training functions of a
                smartwatch, but in a specialized way to this discipline through a mobile application.

            <p>
                Pointé is expected to be a leader in the market, becoming a vital tool for the academic and professional
                training of a classical dancer in important companies and academies within the European Union such as
                the Bolshoi, Paris Opera Ballet, Mariinsky Ballet, Royal Ballet Academy, Royal Opera House, or La Scala
                in Milan.

            </h1>
            <p>
                To provide support to students, teachers and professionals of classical dance throughout their careers.
                Pointé seeks to take care of the physical performance of the dancer in order to enhance the results, and
                in turn, reduce the effort or overload in certain parts of the body that could cause a severe injury
                that could represent at some point the end of a career.
