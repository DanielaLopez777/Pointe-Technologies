                <strong>What is most detrimental to a dancer's life?</strong>
                <br>
                In the survey made to several professionals of classical dance, as well as to dancers in their last
                grades of study, it was obtained that the greatest complication within this art is usually injuries and
                surgeries, almost doubling the percentage of answers in comparison with the rest of the options.

                <strong>What are the most common injuries?</strong>
                <br>
                Injuries within ballet tend to be as varied, from the feet to the neck, due to the fact that it is one
                of the most physically demanding sports. However, injuries along the entire foot, calf and knees are
                more common.

                <strong>What injuries have the professionals suffered?</strong>
                <br>
                As we can see in the graph obtained, professionals tend to suffer mostly from muscle overload, instep
                sprain, and Achilles tendon. The most common injuries are usually located in the lower leg, covering the
                entire area of the foot and calf.

                <strong>Ways of preventing injuries</strong>
                <br>
                Classical dance professionals mostly agree that the best ways to prevent future injuries are
                conditioning exercises and the correct application of technique, which boils down to full physical
                awareness and self-care performance.

                <strong>Causes of injury</strong>
                <br>
                In addition to the previous survey question, the main cause of injury is the incorrect application of
                technique, which makes sense, considering that its counterpart was selected as the best way to prevent
                injury.

                A field survey was conducted to find out which colors are related to ballet, using color psychology to
                implement it in the products of this collection of technologies.

                The acceptance of the technology by the target public is quite good, so little resistance to the change
                and innovation that our product would represent is expected.

                <strong>Opinions on technology applied in ballet</strong>
                <br>
                Most of the classical professionals, consider of great importance and usefulness the technology to learn
                new exercises or choreography, to keep the rhythm of the classes during the pandemic, and to be able to
                see the different classical works that are presented in theaters throughout the world. Judging by the
                opinions gathered, there is no product similar to ours on the market so far that focuses on the constant
                monitoring of movements and routines of the dancer, in order to prevent future injury.

                <br>
                As part of gathering requirements, we asked what features would make our application more attractive,
                with the intention of implementing it. Our application and website are extremely intuitive, with a
                minimalist style that makes it elegant, yet simple to use.

                <strong>Technology areas in ballet</strong>
                <br>
                Within the classical area of dance, the technology is only known to be widely used for theatrical
                lighting and durable materials for footwear. So far there are not, nor have there been as many training
                devices as in other sports.
